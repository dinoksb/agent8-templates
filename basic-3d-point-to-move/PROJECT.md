# 3D Point-to-Move Game

## Project Summary

This project is a 3D game where players control a character through a point-and-click movement system from a quarter view perspective. The game features character animations, physics-based movement, and a 3D environment. Players can click on the ground to move their character and use keyboard inputs to perform various actions (walking, running, jumping, attacking, etc.). This project is intended for single-player gameplay with an emphasis on intuitive mouse-based navigation.

## Implementation Strategy

This game uses a **Three.js-based 3D approach**:

- React Three Fiber for 3D rendering in a React environment
- @react-three/rapier for physics simulation
- vibe-starter-3d library for character rendering and animation
- Quarter view camera setup providing an angled top-down view of the game world
- Raycasting system for converting screen clicks to world positions

Key technologies:

- Three.js - 3D rendering
- React Three Fiber - React integration
- @react-three/rapier - Physics simulation
- @react-three/drei - Useful Three.js helpers
- vibe-starter-3d - Character rendering and animation
- Tailwind CSS - UI composition

## Implemented Features

- Point-and-click movement system (click on the ground to move character)
- Targeting system with visual feedback (click effect animations)
- Character animations (idle, walk, run, jump, attack, etc.)
- Various character state management (IDLE, WALK, RUN, JUMP, PUNCH, KICK, etc.)
- Physics-based character movement with automatic pathfinding
- Quarter view camera perspective
- Environmental collision detection
- Keyboard and mouse control options
- 3D model rendering with animations
- Interactive ground plane
- Animation system with support for looping and one-shot animations
- Character bounding box calculations
- Raycasting for precise mouse interaction with the 3D environment
