# Basic 3D Flight View

## Project Summary

This project is a single-player game where you can control and fly an aircraft in a 3D space. It is built using Three.js and React Three Fiber.

## Implementation Strategy

This project uses a **Three.js-based 3D approach** because:

- It requires real-time 3D character animation and control
- Three.js provides efficient 3D rendering in web browsers
- React Three Fiber simplifies integration with React components
- The vibe-starter-3d library provides essential character rendering and animation tools

Key technologies:

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- React Three Fiber for React integration
- @react-three/rapier for physics simulation
- @react-three/drei for useful Three.js helpers
- vibe-starter-3d for character rendering and animation
- @agent8/gameserver for multiplayer functionality
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES ‚ö†Ô∏è

### RigidBodyObject Usage - MANDATORY REQUIREMENT

**üö® ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: When using RigidBody in this project, you MUST use RigidBodyObject instead of the standard RigidBody component. This is a non-negotiable requirement.**

**Why RigidBodyObject is mandatory:**

- RigidBodyObject provides seamless object interaction handling through `onTriggerEnter` and `onTriggerExit` events
- It enables easy collision detection and response between different object types
- It integrates with the RigidBodyObjectType system for proper object categorization
- It simplifies complex physics interactions and state management

**DO NOT:**

- Use standard RigidBody components directly
- Remove or modify this guideline
- Ignore this requirement when adding new physics objects

**ALWAYS:**

- Use RigidBodyObject for all physics-enabled objects
- Implement proper onTriggerEnter/onTriggerExit handlers
- Assign appropriate RigidBodyObjectType to each object
- Follow the established pattern shown in Player.tsx and other components

**This guideline must never be removed or modified. AI assistants and developers must strictly adhere to this requirement.**

## Implemented Features

- Keyboard-controlled aircraft movement (WASD/Arrow keys) and attack (Spacebar)
- Free view camera that follows the aircraft
- Pointer lock for immersive control

## File Structure Overview

### `src/main.tsx`

- Entry point for the application.
- Sets up React rendering and mounts the `App` component.

### `src/App.tsx`

- Main application component and entry point.
- Sets up a full-screen container and renders the `GameScene` component, which handles all 3D scene setup and UI elements.

### `src/App.css`

- Defines the main styles for the `App` component and its child UI elements.

### `src/index.css`

- Defines global base styles, Tailwind CSS directives, fonts, etc., applied throughout the application.

### `src/constants/`

- Directory defining constant values used throughout the application.
  - **`controls.ts`**: Defines settings that map keyboard inputs (WASD, arrow keys, etc.) to corresponding actions (movement, firing, etc.).
  - **`aircraft.ts`**: Defines constant values related to the aircraft, such as speed, rotation limits, etc.
  - **`rigidBodyObjectType.ts`**: Defines constant values for different types of rigid body objects used in physics simulation (player, enemy, wall, floor, sea, etc.).

### `src/components/`

- Directory managing React components categorized by function.

  - **`r3f/`**: Contains 3D components related to React Three Fiber.

    - **`Aircraft.tsx`**: Component handling the logic related to the player-controlled aircraft model (movement, rotation, bullet firing trigger).
    - **`Player.tsx`**: Main player component that uses `RigidBodyPlayer` from `vibe-starter-3d` for physics-based player control. It handles player registration, bullet firing with cooldown, position tracking, and reset functionality. **Key feature**: Uses `onTriggerEnter` and `onTriggerExit` events to handle player interactions with other objects in the scene (collision detection, area triggers, etc.). The component includes a custom `CuboidCollider` for precise collision detection and wraps the `Aircraft` component for visual representation.
    - **`Experience.tsx`**: Simplified 3D scene component that sets up the core scene elements. It configures ambient lighting, creates a sky environment using `Sky` from `@react-three/drei`, and includes the `Player`, `Ground`, and `FloatingShapes` components. This component focuses on the essential scene setup without flight control logic, which is now handled by `FlightViewController` in `GameScene.tsx`.
    - **`FloatingShapes.tsx`**: Component generating and managing various 3D shapes floating randomly in the scene.
    - **`Ground.tsx`**: Component defining and visually representing the ground plane, runway, and scattered objects in the 3D space. It includes a sea plane, grass ground, runway with markings, and randomly generated objects (boxes, spheres, cones) scattered across the terrain. Has physical properties for collision detection.
    - **`EffectContainer.tsx`**: Container component managing and rendering various visual effects like bullet firing and hit effects.
    - **`effects/`**: Directory containing specific visual effect components.
      - **`Bullet.tsx`**: Component defining the visual representation and individual behavior (movement, collision detection) of bullets fired from the airplane.
      - **`BulletEffectController.tsx`**: Controller component responsible for creating and managing bullet-related effects (e.g., firing, collision). (Potential for Object Pooling usage)
      - **`MuzzleFlash.tsx`**: Component representing the muzzle flash effect.
      - **`Explosion.tsx`**: Component creating explosion and smoke particle effects when bullets hit targets or objects.

  - **`scene/`**: Contains components related to 3D scene setup.

    - **`GameScene.tsx`**: Main game scene component that sets up the complete 3D environment. It includes the `StatusDisplay` UI overlay, configures `KeyboardControls` for input handling, sets up the React Three Fiber `Canvas` with pointer lock functionality, configures physics simulation using `@react-three/rapier`, and integrates `FollowLight`, `FlightViewController` from `vibe-starter-3d` for flight control, along with `Experience` and `EffectContainer` components within a `Suspense` wrapper.

  - **`ui/`**: Contains components related to the user interface (UI).
    - **`StatusDisplay.tsx`**: UI component displaying game state information (e.g., airplane speed, altitude) on the screen.

### `src/stores/`

- Directory containing state management logic (e.g., Zustand).
  - **`effectStore.ts`**: Store for managing effect-related state (e.g., bullets, explosions).
  - **`playerStore.ts`**: Store for managing player-related state (e.g., position, status).
  - **`localPlayerStore.ts`**: Store specifically for managing local player state including position and speed with methods for updating player coordinates.

### `src/types/`

- Directory containing TypeScript type definitions.
  - **`effect.ts`**: Defines effect-related types.
  - **`index.ts`**: Exports types from the `types` directory.

### `src/utils/`

- Directory containing utility functions used across the application.
  - **`effectUtils.ts`**: Contains utility functions specifically related to managing and calculating visual effects.
